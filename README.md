# Modelling Gap Acceptance behavior of the driver at unsignalized intersections

Precise prediction of gap acceptance at uncontrolled road sections is important for developing real-time applications such as Advanced Warning and Safety System (AWSS). The paper applies and compares prediction results of three non-parametric models, namely, SVM, Decision tree and Random Forest algorithm.
